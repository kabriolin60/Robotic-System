# Robotic-System

Robotic system is a French team, wich goal was to participate to the French robotic cup.
Afer some years we decided to re-build the robot's code and release it with some documentation.

This repo holds (or will) electronique schematics and manufacturing files. As well as a presentation & explaination document.

Then you'll found in the Workspaces, the code (after re-writting) with the 2 firsts folders (0_LPC_xxx) with the low-level drivers.
Then IA_2021 and MultiFonction_2021 respectively the code for the IA board and for the Multi-functions board.
